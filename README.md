# Multi-threaded_Event_Reservation_system
This project involves implementing a multi-threaded event reservation system for the Nehru Centre, managing up to 100 events with a maximum capacity of 500 seats per event. The system supports three types of queries: checking available seats, booking tickets, and canceling reservations, while ensuring data consistency through mutual exclusion and a limit on concurrent active queries. Using pthreads, the program simulates worker threads making random queries while respecting concurrency constraints, and ultimately, it provides a final status report of all reservations after the system runs for a specified duration.
